# Error Message

NOTE:  THIS IS A 10F200 project.  This represents the general case.

This is probably... case sensitivity but I am not sure.

In the source INC file config 1... is OSC_IntRC.... NOTE the case.


		_OSC_IntRC           EQU  H'0FFF'; This is the only option. It is here for backward compatibility
		_IntRC_OSC           EQU  H'0FFF'; This is the only option. It is here for backward compatibility

So, unless the user gets the case 100% they will not be able to compile.
